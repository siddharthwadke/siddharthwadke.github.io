About me
A small introduction about my self

Rohan Ranshinge
Business Analyst | UC Davis MSBA | AWS Cloud Practitioner Certified
I'm a Business Analytics student at UC Davis with previous work experience at Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd. 
I'm a life long learner and am very interested in analytics and all the doors it can open for you. 
I'm always curious to learn more on how I can improve and be the best version of myself.

I love playing football (that's soccer here in America) and have been supporting Arsenal FC since 2004. The year of the Invincibles!

Over the past 3 years I have got the opportunity to learn extensively from my seniors and my peers. Turning data into valuable information is a key skill to have in this day and age
